The goal of maRsden is to provide easy access to all data collected at the Marsden Farm Long Term Cropping Systems Research Farm, managed by Dr. Matt Liebman at Iowa State University.

Installation
------------

You can install the development version of maRsden using devtools

``` r
#devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```

Progress
--------

The package currently includes the following data:

1.  mrs\_plotkey (each year's plot treatments, 2012-2019)
2.  mrs\_cornbio13\_wo and mrs\_cornbio14\_wo (WO corn biomass data from 2013-2014)
3.  hmm

Example
-------

If you want to load the corn yield data this will make it much easier.

``` r
#library(maRsden)

# data(mrs_cornyield)
```

Or maybe you want to look at Will Osterholtz's corn biomass data. That's easy!

``` r
#data(mrs_cornbio_wo)
```
