Destructive corn biomass sample collection

Minimum information needed for correct corn biomass sample labeling: 
SITE e.g. AMES
DATE mm/dd/yy
HARVEST H1,H2,H3… Hn
CROP Corn
PLOT ###
ORGAN Green Leaf, Dead leaf, Stem, Ear

1. Select a 1.3m (51.2 inches) row section from the sampling area. 

2. Count the number of plants from the section.

3. Cut the aboveground part of the plants at the soil level using pruning clippers or a sharp hook knife, and take all the plants. 
Place plants in large, plastic bags and bring back the whole plant sample (typically ~7-9 plants for corn) for partitioning.
Store them in a cool shady spot while transporting them.

4. In the lab, detach the ears (if any) from the stems and place them in a labeled paper bag. 
Cut the stem into 2-4 inch segments using clippers, and place them in another labeled paper bag.
Separate the plant into:
Green leaves
Yellow leaves
Stems, cob, tassle (in 2018 and 2019 this was different, so they all got lumped together)
Kernels (grain)

NOTES:
SHOULD have done: tassel, leaf sheaths, cobs, husks category separate from stems
Green and yellow leaves were combined for the tidy dataset
