## phenology measurements

A permanently-marked section of 3.05 m (120 inches) for corn was followed throughout the season for crop staging.
This area can be located basically anywhere in the plot, with a 1-row buffer from plot edges and potential sampling areas. 
For easy identification, the section was clearly marked with flags or garden stakes. 


## Corn phenology staging and observations
1. Count the number of plants in this section (pls_nu).

2. Then select 3 representative plants, which are followed for growth and staging observations throughout the growing season. 

3. From these plants, collect the following data:

A) Number of developed leaves (devleaves_nu): A fully developed leaf is one in which the leaf collar is clearly visible. 
Because the first 2-4 leaves senesce and de-attached fairly early in the season, extra steps are needed to keep a tally of the total number of developed (potential) leaves.
At harvest #1 or earlier tally the number of leaves developed by that point on a paper or plastic tag (use bright color materials so it is easy to find).
Attach the tag to the plant right at above the upper-most visible leaf collar. When you come back the next time (~2-4 weeks later), 
count the number of leaves that have developed above the tag, and add them to the tally in the tag. Move the tag again to the upper-most visible leaf collar, and so on.

B) Record number of green leaves (grleaves_nu)
Count the number of actual leaves that is the number of fully developed leaves that are at least less than 75% senesced

C) Record number of functional leaves (funleaves_nu)
This is usually the same as green leaves, but hail damage may render some green leaves non-functional.

D) Plant height (plht_cm)
Measure plant height (in inches or cm) from the soil to the top visible leaf collar.
