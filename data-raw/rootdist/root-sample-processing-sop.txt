# Root samples soil sub-sampling process

1. Take soil sub-samples
The fresh weight of the bag is recorded, ~200 grams of fresh soil weight is removed, roots are removed from the soil and put back in the bag. 
Soil and subsamples are stored in cooler of 1st floor Archontoulis lab.
Red tub is 'processed' soils. Alfalfa (3 samplings), oats, and corn are in there. 
# NOTE: ignore the sampid column on the freshwt data sheets. Use the log-samp-processing sample ids for all labels and future reference. 

# Root washing process
1. Use a capful of sodium hexmetabiphosphate in the big tub.
2. Put enough in a plastic tupperware to cover the soil. Break up chunks, let it sit while you prepare other ones. 
3. I can't remember......argh
Basically wash the roots through the mesh thing ~15 minutes, get them into a jar. You can sort them later, but don't wait more than 1 week.
