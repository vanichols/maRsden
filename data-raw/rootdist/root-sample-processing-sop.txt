# Root samples soil sub-sampling process

1. Take soil sub-samples
The fresh weight of the bag is recorded, ~200 grams of fresh soil weight is removed, roots are removed from the soil and put back in the bag. 
Soil and subsamples are stored in cooler of 1st floor Archontoulis lab.
Red tub is 'processed' soils. Alfalfa (3 samplings), oats, and corn are in there. 
# NOTE: ignore the sampid column on the freshwt data sheets. Use the log-samp-processing sample ids for all labels and future reference. 
# NOTE: cooler broke and samples were moved - I think ones that had already been processed got mixed up...
noticed 4/29/2020 when Mickala gave me sheet w/new sub-samples listed

# Root washing process
1. Use a capful of sodium hexmetabiphosphate in the big tub.
2. Put enough in a plastic tupperware to cover the soil. Break up chunks, let it sit while you prepare other ones. 
3. I can't remember......argh
Basically wash the roots through the mesh thing ~15 minutes, get them into a jar. You can sort them later, but don't wait more than 1 week. 

# Root sorting
Mickala kept only white roots. Roots that were browning were kept if the root was more than 50% white

# Root scanning
720 dpi, Epson something, save pic as jpeg
plexiglass thing, put 'window' in middle, pour water on outside of window.
This keeps the water currents from pulling roots to the outside.
Once water (solo cup full) is in, dump root sample inside window
Separate roots as best as possible.
Remove window, wrangle roots away from sides.
Scan. Sometimes it is black and white, sometimes color, that's fine. 
Scan. Dump water through little sieve thing, put roots in aluminum tin.

# Root weights
Dry at 60 deg C for 72 hours.
Weigh using scale in Castellano lab (very sensitive). 
Place in envelope.
